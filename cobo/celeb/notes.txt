DISCO
- You can create a GUI creates an interactive interface in which you can click buttons and type in inputs
- Before setting up the GUI, always set up the base version first (it should work in the terminal)
- make sure to use the setVisible(true) call in order to make sure everything shows up in the GUI

QCC
- We are planning to skip over the useless questions. We will do the open-ended activity if time permits.
- Is there any other way to set up a GUI in java?
