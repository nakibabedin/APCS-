### TODO
- ~Plan out Celebrity and CelebrityGame classes~
- ~Instantiate methods of Celebrity, add instance variables (Act 2)~
- ~Test Celebrity's methods, ensure it works~
- ~Instantiate methods of CelebrityGame, add instance variables (Act 3)~
- ~Extend Celebrity to work with different types of Celebrities. Alter methods accordingly. (Act 4)~
- ~Set up GUI, update CelebrityFrame to work with CelebrityGame. (Act 3, Act 4)~

### Experience
We thought activity 2 and 3 were simple to do. Working with GUI was a lot to take in at once and frustrating to work with. It cost us some time. In the end, we were able to get it done.
