### Team (P)BNJ - Brian Li, Nakib Abedin, Jefford Shau
## Experience
- Looking up information about data privacy and the effects of using collecting data was very interesting. 
- We did not really see the value in some of the open ended questions.
- We struggled in getting -classpath to work on Windows using Git Bash.
- The rest of the lab seemed pretty easy, just time consuming.
