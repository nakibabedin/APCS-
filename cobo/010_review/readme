Summary of experience:
  cobo made us do a lot of useless things.
  We should have made a word parser.
  Hashmaps can be used to parse .csv and .txt files.
  We realized how powerful .trim() can be.

errata:

* hashmap is java equivalent to the python dictionaries you know and love
* nothing else should seem too unfamiliar to a Thinker
