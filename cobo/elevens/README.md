### DISCO
- Use "" or  \ before a space character to traverse through a dir with spaces in its name.

### QCC
- Why would we want to use List<> var = new ArrayList() instead of ArrayList<> var = new ArrayList()?

### Summary
- This was a good experience and refresher in working with multiple objects and abstract methods/interfaces. 
- We thought the question were a bit tedious to do, though.
