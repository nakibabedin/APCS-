DISCO
- Use "" or  \ before a space character to traverse through a dir with spaces in its name.

QCC
- Why would we want to use List<> var = new ArrayList() instead of ArrayList<> var = new ArrayList()?
*/

Act 2
1. A deck contains a list of cards.
2. 6 cards
3. String[] ranks = {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A"};
   String[] suits = {"diamond", "club", "heart", "spade"};
   int[] pointValues = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11};
4. Yes, the order of ranks should correspond with the order of pointValues, such that index i of ranks
   should have the pointValue of pointValues[i].

Act 3
1. public static String flip(){
      if ((int)(Math.random() * 3) == 2){
        return "tails";
      }
      else { return "heads"; }
   }
2. public static boolean arePermutations(int[] arr1, int[] arr2){
     boolean isInArr2;
     for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++){
       isInArr2 = false;
       for (int j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++){
         if (arr1[i] == arr2[j]){
           isInArr2 = true;
         }
       }
       if (!isInArr2) { return false; }
     }
     return true;
   }
3. 3,2,1,0

Act 7
1. int BOARD_SIZE, String[] POINT_VALUES, String[] SUITS, String[] RANKS, Card[] cards, Deck deck
2. With a shuffled deck:
   Deal 9 cards from the deck.
   Make removals and replace cards if needed.
   If another play is NOT possible, end the game.
   If the board is empty, win. Else, lose.
3. It would still work because the instance variables would still work and be instantiated.
4a. In the constructor and newGame().
4b. isLegal(), anotherPlayIsPossible()
4c. 0,1,3,6,7
4d. for (int i : cIndexes){
      System.out.println(board.cardAt[i]);
    }
4e. anotherPlayIsPossible() so we are able to get the indices of all cards currently on the board to check
    if there is a pair of cards whose sum is 11 or if there is is JQK.

Act 8
1. There is a different size board used and the specific sums of cards necessary are different for each game.
   They are all played on a board as card games.
2. The ElevensBoard can pass this information to the Board superclass. The mechanism used is super(args being passed).
3. They cover all the differences as we only need to change the legal conditions of each game and board size.
