/*
DISCO
- .split() makes it much easier to eliminate whitespace.
- You can use multiple stacks to track different things.

QCC
- Is there a better way to do subtraction with a stack?

/***
 * class Scheme
 * Simulates a rudimentary Scheme interpreter
 *
 * ALGORITHM for EVALUATING A SCHEME EXPRESSION:
 *   1. Split the string into an array of strings, without the whitespace
     2. Push strings into corresponding stack (operation, everything else)
     3. If the string is a closing paren, evaluate all values before the next
        open paren.
          Your operation is popped from the operation stack.
          Your values are popped from the arr stack.
          Pop the opening paren in the arr stack, and then push the evaluated
          value to the arr stack.
     4. Repeat until you have iterated thru the entire expression.
     5. Return the popped value of the arr stack, which is your final answer.
 *
 * STACK OF CHOICE: Stack by java.util.Stack
 * b/c ... An imported library eliminates clutter, and there is no limitation
           on the length of the Stack.
