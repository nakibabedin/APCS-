DISCO
  * We simplified our remove method into three main cases: leaf nodes, nodes with 1 subtree, and nodes with 2 subtrees.
  * We used recursion for the case where the node had 2 subtrees.
QCC
  * How can we do remove() more recursively? Can this be optimized?

ALGO
Go to the node preceding the target we plan to remove.
CASE 1:
If we are removing a leaf, set the piggyback's left/right node to null.
  - If the target is the root, set the root to null.
CASE 2:
If we are removing a node with only one subtree, the set the piggyback's
left/right child to the target's left/right child.
  - If the target is the root, set the root to the target's left/right child.
CASE 3:
If we are removing a node with two subtrees, store the value of the rightmost
leaf of the subtree's left branch and remove that leaf.
Then, replace the value of the target node with the stored value.
