DISCO
- thinkers are sometimes receiving two piles before splitting.
- handsa-out method is really effective
QCC
- should thye be making a third pile when sorting?

THINKER FIRMWARE
if pile not sorted, split and give to two empty handed thinkerin
if pile sorted, return pile to same thinkerin
if two piles are received, sort using the created merge rules
repeat.
