DISCOVERIES
1) For Java methods, you need to specify the type of value that the method will return while defining it. This is done after writing "public static" (E.g. public static int).
2) There is also a return statement in java.
3)Trace diagrams are helpful when we can calling methods inside of other methods such as how we called greet from BigSib.class inside of SOP.

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS
1) No unresolved Questions.

public class Greet {
  public static void main (String [] args){
	System.out.println(BigSib.greet("Crosby"));
	System.out.println(BigSib.greet("Stills"));
	System.out.println(BigSib.greet("Nash"));
	}
