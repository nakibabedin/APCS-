DISCO
1) We used the helper methods to set up the recursion and the main method to call the recursion.

QCC
1) How do you know which node to insert a node in a binary search tree (there are multiple valid locations)?
2) Does height indexing begin at 0 or at 1?

With L = level, d = depth, h = heightâ€¦

a perfect binary tree has 2^h - 1 nodes (assuming height begins at 1)
at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^(L-1) nodes
height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is ceiling of log base 2 of n
