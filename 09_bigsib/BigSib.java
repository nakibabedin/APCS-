HW09 -- What Are BigSibs Good For?
2021-10-03

DISCOVERIES
1) You can call methods from another file as long as the file is in the same directory.
2) You don't need to have a main method if you aren't planning to execute the code directly. The functions can still be called in a different file and executed accordingly.
3) To call a function from a certain file, the format is <className>.<methodName>
UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS
1) No unresolved mysteries.
