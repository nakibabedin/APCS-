Error messages mean that something is wrong, but the suggested remedies may be unreliable. 



If a program is hanging, that means that it is caught in an infinite loop.



Add a print statement when entering the loop and one when exiting. If the first pops up but not the second, then the problem is with the loop.



QCC: How does Java know there is an infinite recursion.



Found it interesting how binary search is was applied to find errors
