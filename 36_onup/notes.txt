First Read Notes:

Error messages mean that something is wrong, but the suggested remedies may be unreliable.

If a program is hanging, that means that it is caught in an infinite loop.

Add a print statement when entering the loop and one when exiting. If the first pops up but not the second, then the problem is with the loop.

QCC: How does Java know there is an infinite recursion.

Found it interesting how binary search is was applied to find errors (binary disection)

Second Read Notes:

Three Types of Errors:
1) Compile Time
2) Run Time
3) Logic

  1) Compile Time errors are usually due to some syntactical issues.
      - Make sure you are compiling the right file
      - Error messages should guide you, but they won't be able to tell you explicitly what is wrong.
      - It is best to reach compatibility ASAP so that when you get an Error, you can narrow it down to a specific region.
  2) Run Time errors are usually due to errors in the content of the code (e.g infinite loop/ infinite recursion)
      - Use print statements when entering/ exiting a loop/ recursion. If You see only the statement for entering,
      then chances are that the loop/ recursion is not built properly.
      - Make sure to check the base case for recursion
      - Stack Overflow error
  3) Logic errors are errors in functionality.
      - Only the coder/coders will know the intended functionality. There will be no error messages to deal with.
        The best way to approach these types of problems is mapping out the flow of execution and making
        changes to it in order to better suit the functionality.
